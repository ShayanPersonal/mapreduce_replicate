In this assignment, you are required to implement the simplest word count
example as an application of map/reduce. Assume we have multiple text files
and we want to count the occurrence of each word to determine the most popular
words in group of documents. You have multiple computing nodes and each
node is running multiple processes to process these files. You are required to implement
a Command Line Interface (CLI) where clients can submit files to your
map, reduce, and replicate processes. You are required to implement the MapReduce
Replicate assingment in a Cloud environment, eg, UCSBâ€™s Eucalyptus,
or any other publically available cloud, such as AWS, AZURE, Google Cloud
Engine, etc. Figure 1 illustrates a generic design for the map/reduce replicate
architecture. In Section 2, we explain the details of the architecture design components.
In Section 3, we explain the details of the client API. Milestones are
listed in Section 4 and submission guidelines in Section 5.
